# Mandelbrot Generator

## Introduction

This project is for generating Mandelbrot fractal images. It is multithreading and can take advantage of multiple CPU cores via parallel processing. It currently supports single precision. In the near future, it will support double precision and arbitrary precision.

## Implementation Details

This project uses Mandelbrot convergence set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) equation to generate the fractal. It uses the execellent stbi header-only library to write the image data into a file (https://github.com/nothings/stb).

## Usage

The program accepts eight command line arguments:

### Image Size

This is an integer argument with the default value of 512. The image generated is always a square with the length specified through this argument.

### X and Y Positions

These two are float arguments with the default value of -0.75 and 0.0. Increasing X will move the view to the right and decreasing X will move the view to the left. Similarly, increasing Y will move the view up and decreasing Y will move the view down.

### Zoom

This is a float argument with the default value of 3.0. Increasing this will make the image zoom out and decreasing it will make the image zoom in.

### Maximum Iterations

This is an integer argument with the default value of 512. Increasing this will increase the details of the image. This is especially usefuly when you want to generate a zoomed in view of the Mandelbrot fractal.

### Color Mode

This is an integer argument with the default value of 0. This can be used to alter the coloring mode of the final image. Please use the following information to see the available options:

0       Simple Grayscale
1       Smooth Grayscale

### Maximum Threads

This is an integer argument with the default value of 1. If the system has pthreads available and multiple cores, increasing the number of threads can increase performance.

### Output Image

This is a string argument with the default value of "mandelbrot.jpg". Note that changing the extension from jpg to png or any other format will not change the actual file format. Use this argument to prevent overwriting previous images.

### Note

The arguments must be specified in the order they are listed here. Any unspecified arguments will assume default values. Invoking without any arguments is similar to invoking like so: `mandelbrot 512 -0.75 0.0 3.0 512 mandelbrot.jpg`

## Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project root directory. Run `mkdir build && cd build` then run `../configure` then run `make` then run `make install`. You should be able to run the program using `mandelbrot`. You can uninstall it by running `make uninstall`.
